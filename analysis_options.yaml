# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# Minimal analyzer config to avoid CI/lint failures during initial import.
# You can re-enable `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml` later and fix
# reported issues incrementally.
